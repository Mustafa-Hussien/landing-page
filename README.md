#Landing Page Project

This landing page is made repsonsive to work on all devices (desktop/tablet/mobile).

I added active class to the current section in the viewport and another active class to the link in the navbar,

Each link in the navbar is added dynamically based on the number of sections available.

Additionally, there're event listeners added for scrolling the browser window and clicking the navbar links,

These events and active classes add smoothness to the landing page and make it easy to navigate.
